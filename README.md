# 🌱 Carbon Footprint Estimation from Fertilizer Usage

## Overview
This project aims to estimate the carbon emissions generated due to fertilizer usage in agriculture and recommend sustainable fertilizer practices. It also includes predictive models to suggest the optimal type and quantity of fertilizer based on soil nutrients, weather conditions, and crop requirements.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Fertilizer overuse leads to environmental pollution and contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Farmers lack access to tools that help balance agricultural productivity with environmental sustainability. This project addresses the need for intelligent fertilizer planning and carbon impact analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the type and quantity of fertilizer suitable for specific soil and crop conditions.
- Estimate carbon emissions associated with the predicted fertilizer usage.
- Suggest more sustainable alternatives or optimal combinations to minimize environmental impact.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
## 📊 Input Parameters
